Main measures to improve performance
------------------------------------

+ Introduce server-side caching so repeated requests don’t hit the database. This is the most important improvement, since the main bottleneck was caused by excessive repeated queries.

+ Reduce database load by optimizing queries and indexes: I modified the repository/entity configuration for the Model and Type tables to make them more efficient, added some indexes, and corrected the DB relationship (changed OneToOne to ManyToOne in Model & Type).

+ Scale the database horizontally using read replicas to absorb remaining read traffic. This isn’t reflected in the code since we’re using an H2 in-memory database, but it’s something I would implement in a real production environment.


Notes regarding server-side caching
-----------------------------------

+ I assume the data does not need to be instantly refreshed after being loaded into the system. That’s why I set Redis to refresh every hour, although this can be adjusted in application.properties. Since this information doesn’t change frequently, a longer-lived cache (more than 1 hour) could also be appropriate.

+ Another option would have been to use Spring Cache backed by Caffeine, but in a production environment with multiple instances a Redis-based cache is generally more efficient because it is shared across nodes.

+ Alternative for caching Makes: Since the Makes table is small, another option is to load the entire table into memory per instance. This data changes rarely, so a nightly update with a cron job could work as well.

+ I didn’t add @Cacheable for getTypeById, getMakeById, or getModelById because I assumed these endpoints would be less frequently used. The most common flows should be:
 - Get all Makes → get the Models for one Make → get the Types for that Model
 - Get Models by MakeId → get the Types for that Model
That said, those endpoints can also be cached if needed.


General notes
-------------

+ I didn’t modify the endpoints themselves, assuming the requirement was to keep the existing API and simply improve how they interact with the database. If response structures could be changed, I would optimize them—for example, getModelsByMakeId always returns the Make inside each Model, which is redundant.

+ I focused only on the assessment requirements. I didn’t modify other areas that could be improved (e.g., handling NotFoundException when searching by ID). I can add these if needed, but understood they were outside the scope.
